# JSON Feed plugin
A WordPress plugin powering [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1) s for a site. Early implementation, exploring the format in code.

## Code Layout
Each major object of a JSON Feed -- feed, item, and author -- receive its own PHP objects to validate and clean up submitted content. These objects could be standard PHP with sanitizers provided to validate a URL string or strip HTML content.

String sanitization is WordPress-specific, using [esc_url_raw](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_url_raw/) and [wp_kses](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_kses/) for URLs and plain-text strings respectively.

WordPress site, post, and author information is collected in a "Builder" class. The builder checks for post type capabilities before including a property. Strings are passed through RSS-specific filters for consistency with RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feeds generated by WordPress Core.
